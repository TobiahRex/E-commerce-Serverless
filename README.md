# [E-commerce | Serverless | "Nic Juice 2 Japan"](https://nj2jp.com) (_NJ2JP_):
E-commerce store providing nicotine vape juice to Japanese customers faster than anyone.
  - Deployed using _Serverless_ | AWS Lambda | AWS S3.  
  - Backend API = **GraphQL**.
  - Database utilizes a **Mongo Cluster** with 3 nodes. 2 Full + 1 Arbiter.
  - Client-side API requests are generated from **Apollo Client** wrapped components.
  - Other Client-side API requests are generated using **redux-sagas** and the npm library **api-sauce** that adds an abstraction layer to **axios**.
  - The rest of the app sits on **React.js** & **React Router*(V3)** (with Code splitting), **Redux** & **Redux Persist** (with WebStorage).

## Site Address
 [Nic Juice 2 Japan](https://d2ezb8t4pwbclo.cloudfront.net).
  - ‚òùüèº That site is under **Heavy Development** and may at times, not be working.  Will update here once availability is 100%.

## Splash Preview

## SETUP:
  - `npm i` || `yarn` to install dependencies
  - `npm start` for development server
  - `npm run build` for production server

  ### OPTIONAL
  - `touch .gitignore` I use a global `.gitignore_global` file so you should add your own so as not to push `node_modules/` once you've completed `npm i`.
  - `brew update`
  - `brew install libpng` for webpack image loader (image-webpack-loader [see here](https://github.com/tcoopman/image-webpack-loader))

  ### NOTES:
  1. I Highly recommend running `npm update --save` || `yarn upgrade` to update package.json &/or yarn.lock before running `npm start` or `npm run build`.
  2. You may need to do a `brew update` for some of the webpack image loaders to properly work.
  3. If you're following our strategy and deploying the static site to Amazon S3, then you can also run `deploy-to-s3`.  Be sure to modify the bucket name.

## WARNINGS:
  * Uses `webpack version 2.0`.
  * Node engine explicitly defined in `package.json` for `node@7.7.3`.
  * If you are not compliant with these versions, it's HIGHLY recommended you update.

# NOTES:
  1. ### Redux Reducers:
    * This bp's Redux reducer methods rely on the developer to customize the logic to maintain immutability of state. This was done _intentionally_ to strengthen developers abilities in manipulating state.  If this feels cumbersome, I highly recommend using _seamless-immutable_ (refs below) to outsource this process in a very clean, and simple way.

# Important Launch Notes:
  1. Modifiy LAMBDA_GRAPHQL env variable throughout `src/` application to point to the `production` database & lambda endpoint.
  2. Modify the serverless MONGO_URI env variable inside the AWS console dashboard.
