# Nic Juice 2 Japan (_NJ2JP_):
E-commerce store providing nicotine vape juice to Japanese customers faster than anyone.
  - Deployed using _Serverless_ | AWS Lambda.  
  - Backend API = **GraphQL**.
  - Database utilizes a **Mongo Cluster** with 3 nodes. 2 Full + 1 Arbiter.
  - Client requests are generated from **Apollo Client** wrapped components.
  - The rest of the app sits on **React.js** & **React Router*(V3)** (with Code splitting), and **Redux**.

## Cloud Architecture

### Development Version deployed on [Amazon S3](http://nj2jp-react.s3-website-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/).
  - ‚òùüèº That _Amazon S3_ link is under **Heavy Development** and may at times, not be working.  Will update here once availability is 100%.

This is a temporary development deployment.
Final Production site will be at http://www.nj2jp.com.

## SETUP:
  - `npm i` || `yarn` to install dependencies
  - `npm start` for development server
  - `npm run build` for production server

  ### OPTIONAL
  - `touch .gitignore` I use a global `.gitignore_global` file so you should add your own so as not to push `node_modules/` once you've completed `npm i`.
  - `brew update`
  - `brew install libpng` for webpack image loader (image-webpack-loader [see here](https://github.com/tcoopman/image-webpack-loader))

  ### NOTES:
  1. I Highly recommend running `npm update --save` || `yarn upgrade` to update package.json &/or yarn.lock before running `npm start` or `npm run build`.
  2. You may need to do a `brew update` for some of the webpack image loaders to properly work.
  3. If you're following our strategy and deploying the static site to Amazon S3, then you can also run `deploy-to-s3`.  Be sure to modify the bucket name.

## WARNINGS:
  * Uses `webpack version 2.0`.
  * Node engine explicitly defined in `package.json` for `node@7.7.3`.
  * If you are not compliant with these versions, it's HIGHLY recommended you update.

## TECHNOLOGIES:
  1. ### API's
    * [fixer.io](http://fixer.io) | Exchange Rates
    * [taxratesapi.avalara.com](http://taxratesapi.avalara.com/) | Tax Rates
    * [ipinfo.io](http://ipinfo.io) | IP address & Geolocation
  2. ### Libraries & Packages
    * Uses _apisauce_ for API calls. See API README.md for details.
    * Uses _redux-sagas_ to call customized api methods.
    * Uses _redux_sauce_ to create Types, Creators & Reducer.
    * Uses _redux-logger_ to allow for informative workflow from the devtools console.  
    * Uses _redux-devtools-extension_ to allow for a macro perspective picture of your current store's state.
    * Configured for front end environment variables using webpack.DefinePlugin().
    * Uses _BEM_ syntax styling for classNames.
    * Airbnb Style Guide implemented.

# NOTES:
  1. ### Redux Reducers:
    * This bp's Redux reducer methods rely on the developer to customize the logic to maintain immutability of state. This was done _intentionally_ to strengthen developers abilities in manipulating state.  If this feels cumbersome, I highly recommend using _seamless-immutable_ (refs below) to outsource this process in a very clean, and simple way.
  2. ### Helper Libraries:

# Updates:
1. March 7th, 2017:
  - Added Sketch Mockups & Wireframes file to `tools/`
  - Responsiveness is still in development. Media Queries are `@media only screen and (max-width : 640px)` for mobile & `@media only screen and (min-wdith : 641px)` for web.  This is a recent change, and I haven't optimized all style sheets for those settings as of yet.
  - Not all stylesheets are implementing _BEM_.  It was recent change and previous naming conventions are still in use for some style sheets.
2. March 28th, 2017:
  - Updated `webpack-image-loader` version from `3.2` to `3.3`.
  - Updated `webpack` to version `2.2`.
  - Updated `node` to version `7.7.3`. Added `engines` object to `package.json`.
3. March 31st, 2017:
  - Cleaned up package.json
  - Removed node_modules/ and re-installed using `yarn`

# Important Launch Notes:
  1. Modifiy LAMBDA_GRAPHQL env variable throughout `src/` application to point to the `production` database & lambda endpoint.
  2. Modify the serverless MONGO_URI env variable inside the AWS console dashboard.
